# Smart Market - Smart Local Marketplace

Smart Market is an intelligent hyper-local marketplace that bridges the gap between buyers and city-wide local sellers. By incorporating Natural Language query processing and Neo4j Graph Database logic, it parses arbitrary intents like "I have a headache" into fully populated cart recommendations spanning optimal local sellers.

## �[ Key Features

- **Smart Search Intents:** Search by symptom or need (e.g. "fever") — the backend evaluates intent and sources a curative bundle of relevant products.
- **Live Delivery Tracking:** Real-time map visualization showing the complete route from seller to buyer with animated delivery progress.
- **Unified Seller & Buyer Roles:** Seamlessly transition between purchasing goods or running your own digital storefronts from a unified UI.
- **Smart Cart Splitting:** Multi-vendor purchases grouped transparently into one Razorpay checkout session.
- **AI Recommendation Chatbot:** Floating helper modal that curates product bundles based on dietary needs, symptoms, or recipes.
- **Seller Dashboard:** Inline CRUD tools for inventory management with live buyer address visualization.
- **Robust Authentication:** JWT-based auth with role gating (buyer, seller, admin).
